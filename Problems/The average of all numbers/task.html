<h2>The average of all numbers</h2>

  <p>Write the code that reads 2 numbers from the keyboard, <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>. As an output, it shows the mean of all numbers that lie on the interval between <em>a</em> and <em>b,</em> and can be divided by 3. </p> 
  <p>What does it mean? In the example, you are to calculate the mean of the numbers in the range <span class="math-tex">\( [-5; 12] \)</span></p> 
  <p>The numbers divided by 3 without the remainder are: <span class="math-tex">\( -3, 0, 3, 6, 9, 12 \)</span>. There are six of them, and the mean is 4.5.</p> 
  <p>The input interval always contains at least one dividend of 3. Remember to include the values of <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> in your calculations.</p> 
  <p><button class="btn-sm btn-outline-secondary" onclick="getElementById('hint-685').style.display='inline'"> Hint </button> </p>
  <div id="hint-685" style="display:none;">
   To calculate the mean, you need to get the sum of the found integers and divide it by the number of these found integers. To get the divider, consider using a separate variable for counting the number of found integers: it should have 0 as the starting value, then 1 should be added to it each time you find an integer that can be divided by 3.
